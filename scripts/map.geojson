It was one of the places where young women from the East could meet and dance with West German businessmen and guests (incl. Bruce Springsteen) in hope that they would bring them Western products on another visit. Heavily bugged, with cameras! Called the “Stasi Nest.” Sources: Wikipedia and personal interviews."
